look at manav's bayesian CNN
and Mahir - bayesian autoencoder
both are using adam and sgd and compare them.


from shaurya's paper
RMSE  across 10 prediction horizons
and 10 step look ahead prediction


talk to animesh for the wrong loss - log loss in shaurya's code

first step_w make it square. 
then report results to rohit.
then make adaptive learning rate, 0.1 and then 0.05 and then 0.01

this is a temporary change
